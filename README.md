# CRYPTO CLUSTERING CHALLENGE

## Background:
The purpose of this repristory is to put use of my knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

    ANALYSIS
   - ***What is the best value for k?*** 4 is the best value for K.
   - ***What is the total explained variance of the three principal components?*** About 89.5% of the total variance is condensed into the three principal components.
   - ***What is the best value for k when using the PCA data?*** 4.
   - ***Does it differ from the best k value found using the original data?*** The best k value found using the PCA data seems to be the same as the best k value found using the original data.
   - ***After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?***  With fewer features used to cluster data using K-means, it seems to reduce the amount of noise in the clusters and make the grouping of the data more clear and interpretable.
